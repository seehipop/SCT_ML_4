# Hand Gesture Recognition

This project demonstrates how to build a hand gesture recognition system using deep learning. The model is trained using the Hand Gesture Recognition Dataset, which is used for classifying different hand gestures captured through images. The model can then be used for real-time gesture-based control systems and human-computer interaction (HCI).
